#Submission of project 1 - Build my World

Write up - 

* In this project I have used all the knowlwdge accumulated in the past lessons which includes localization, SLAM, mapping etc. All the knowledge has been used in the home service project.

* I took help from the turtlebot3 package.

* For localization, amcl package was used which was present beforehand in the turtlebot3_navigation package and slam_gmapping package was used.

* Path was created using Dijkstra's algorithm, a variant of the uniform cost search algorithm.

* I used script files to launch files in an efficient way. Script files used X-term to launch, which has to be installed before in the laptop.

* Pick_objects was made in order to make the robot reach the pickup zone and dropoff zone.

* Add_marker package was made to add virtual objects in the rviz so to make virtual objects appear and to simulate pick and place .

All in all I gained a lot of knowledge during this project!
